This is my personal website that you can see my latest work at :)

Developed via: `React.js (Hooks)` + `Firebase`


<hr>

Notes:
  1) The data for the cards is loaded from `Firebase` :boom: 
  2) The cards are placed via `Flex grid` to accomodate them according to screen space :fire:
  3) Used `local storage` to cache the data from the cards
